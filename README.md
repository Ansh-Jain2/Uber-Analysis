ðŸš• Uber Data Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard
This was my first Power BI project, created as part of a guided learning exercise to explore the capabilities of data visualization and dashboarding. The dataset represents Uber rides, and the objective was to derive insights on ride frequency, popular locations, peak hours, and more.

Despite being a guided project, it was a great starting point to understand Power BI fundamentals â€“ from data cleaning to designing interactive dashboards. There's still a lot to learn, but this marks the beginning of my Power BI journey.
